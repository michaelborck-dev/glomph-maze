## Unreleased


- Remove accidentally committed generated files: GNUmakefile, config.status, makefile.cp (9c5fa57)
- Add History section to README.md from original README notes; remove temp README-ORIG.md (197e8f7)
- Patch Makefile: Use README.md in doc_files, rename MYMAN to glomph-maze (e19591c)
- Expand acknowledgements with original source links (0741fc6)
- Add acknowledgements to README with original sources (db0939c)
- Rename project to Glomph Maze: Update README, INSTALL, docs; set new remote (2596d30)
- removed unused variable (2678ab9)
- add a missing subdir (d7a8131)
- support for EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface) is semi-working using gnu-efi on ia32; at some point an upgrade to a more recent gnu-efi and support for the call wrappers it requires should be attempted; the EFI port relies on my own buggy C library subset (see the efilibc directory), but should probably move to the TianoCore libc assuming it is (a) free and open-source, (b) possible for me to compile and use, and (c) actually produces a working executable (7e7f437)
- do not do an extra redraw if magic arrows are pressed quickly enough (279a971)
- no select() on win32 for ttys (5633bf6)
- CLEAN_ALL was broken (84e61f0)
- minor bugfixes and a slight optimization (RLE, basically) for bitmap rendering (a8a41f4)
- several bugfixes for bitmap mode (0492c82)
- more dos symbols (7d3be83)
- switch from monolithic backing to typesafe backing; this does not use realloc, but really should (69001ba)
- minor fix (524a514)
- major CGA workarounds (7d969ec)
- support bright bg on win32, work around it better elsewhere (8310579)
- more configurable, but less working (At least under DOS) (79968ba)
- simpler way to use mygetopt: -DMYGETOPT; include <io.h> when available since that is where Borland C++ defines isatty; add guessing for Pelles C (__POCC__); factor out HAVE__PGMPTR; sometimes define MAIN_NO_ENVP in guess.h; Borland C++ has putenv(), although it does not seem completely reliable; added extreme paranoia after putenv/setenv/SetEnvironmentVariableA, and use fake env if getenv() does not see the variable we set (27415d0)
- the Win32 build works with HX, too, provided ones does not compile the Unicode version (5c16c8f)
- shorter (81487f1)
- workaround for incomplete win32 headers as seen e.g. in digital mars (4baab97)
- UNICODE <=> _UNICODE (6a634c9)
- horrible typo! (7ce605f)
- set environment variables two different ways on win32 (cc9d61a)
- compiles with mingw g++ with no warnings now (60903fe)
- g++ caught a typo! (29a8956)
- avoid extra calls to set attributes, although it does not seem to make much difference; fix a color bug noticed with pseudobitmap text in 4-color modes (1a52d8b)
- hopefully we now correctly set up the control port for bw40/80 modes too (54151b5)
- better variable name (3fa7dae)
- remap invisible colors (623b843)
- correctly set up bright background mode on CGA (82781e0)
- no longer need pml (2c2b5e3)
- even large tile and sprite files work in 16-bit environments now; this change alters the data structures for tiles and sprites and breaks compatibility with previously generated s2s*.c files and corresponding objects (1ca738e)
- clean up some color bugs (f679ac5)
- address and copyright fixes (e0c013e)
- support bitmap rendering and palette remapping using Open Watcom-style <graph.h> (785bb52)
- use putenv when there is no setenv (8fafd9f)
- getenv return lacks const (c8888b1)
- sometimes system getenv/setenv lack const (6706114)
- provide our own implementation of setenv (myman_setenv) and getenv (myman_getenv) which fall back to an internal environment list when the system setenv() fails or does not exist; use guess.h in all .c files (2301e2e)
- start to support Win16 (maybe) (ecc537c)
- shorter (6f306fc)
- point to page with PML port (2f11e95)

- usleep void (5547841)
- Leopard Rez is dumb and does not know how to read the resource description file from stdin (9dd62b3)
- do not leave an orphan label (43f38f7)
- open watcom has no <sys/socket.h>, at least for MS-DOS (777f909)
- documented more recent drivers (e35f012)
- +graph.h (146cfdc)
- documented graph.h driver (f5243ed)
- detect screen size and color at startup (a582dbd)
- better guesses for Open Watcom (df6adcf)

- works with owcc -bDOS -zm -mtune=i086 -O3 -mcmodel=h (cd235a9)
- make sure usleep replacement returns a value (1ca8ee6)
- still does not work (3b053a2)
- added a wrapper for <graph.h> as found in Open Watcom (e529f3c)
- add CONIOCURSES support (582fb16)
- add graphcur (474e0bf)
- add --with-graph (217502c)
- keep spaces literal in the base case (3169eb6)
- 68k-compatible branch islands (ec8cc04)
- generate branch islands at link time so that relative 16-bit branches don't need to span our entire executable (0a3bbdb)
- typo! (f79a37d)
- refactor a bit (74bcd9c)
- add newlines to help and info text to work around a bug in the pager which leaves transparent areas at the end of the text when the last line is not empty (a5af996)
- factor out gamehelp() ('?') and gameinfo() ('!') (8cf0625)
- prettify more (66405ae)
- prettify (7f314c6)

- factor out some pieces of gamelogic() (b442084)
- +guess.h (6ac2ca9)
- Borland C++ Builder does not define WIN32 (f79cc64)
- remove enough warnings to make bcc32 happy; switch to int for row/col since that's what conio uses (4ca13c0)
- more agressively work around the bogus attributes bug by writing a space and then clearing the screen. seems to fix the problem with DJGPP's <conio.h> (0a083c9)
- removed stray line (cd46e06)
- reset to sane colors and cursor on exit (1ef9761)
- avoid label at end of compound statement (8d8b75b)
- add delch() implementations to our curses replacements; most of the delch() replacements just return ERR (cb42f23)
- include patches in dist (6a9fd73)
- roll back the accidentally-comitted optcurses libcaca bitmap patch yet again (d3768a8)
- no widec (6ffef6c)
- the "b" key now works in pager mode to toggle use of bold/dim; the effects of the "b" and "c" keys now persist across resize/reinit; defining OPTCURSES tells myman.c to pull in "optcurs.h", which works OK with ncurses but not at all with ncursesw (it does not mask/redirect the wide-character calls at all yet) (d39a1c7)
- replace problematic switch with a large if ... else if series (1166494)
- do not index directly into a string literal, do not use #if in the middle of an expression, and don't use SIG_DFL inside ?: (2365a39)
- do not directly index into a string literal (289b4c9)
- added kaypro2x altcharset (block graphics) support; fixed a bug with reverse-video handling in altcharset substitutions; kaypro2x altcharset is also block-addressable using the UCS/Unicode Braille pattern codepoints (65c6bac)
- support altcharset on wy60 (c5d0845)
- use delch()/DCH1 to avoid making the last screen line have an arbitrary number of overflowed characters (9951808)
- document some of the newer environment variables (2b2455f)
- now RAWCURSES_WIDE=t respects RAWCURSES_RELCUP=t (7c9e529)
- RAWCURSES_WIDE: use DEC double-width line (DECDWL) escape sequence to use square character cells on a VT100. (ec92b32)
- jobman (b545fc3)
- add a maze inspired by Norbert Landsteiner's "Lost In Maze! â€“ Robby vs. The Tin Toy Bots" (833a6bb)
- inlined mach_* (6749e12)
- vms++ (95d4532)
- add mach_acs and mach_mypal, which were previously distributed separately (8da935b)
- mach_acs, mach_mypal (e1a8a00)
- note that 8086 MS-DOS RAWCURSES can be built using Digital Mars C/C++ (415a198)
- digital mars does not have <sys/socket.h> (5fa5f9f)
- use 8192, not 32767 (8d25383)

- lots of signedness fixes for older C compilers, thanks to Compaq C on gein.vistech.net: @[.utl]vmsbuild "/define=RAWCURSES/standard=RELAXED_ANSI89/warnings=ENABLE=PORTABLE" (544c9c1)
- less long (48df8b6)
- space around comment (0a8c972)
- fix several bugs in VMS console size handling, and always ask the terminal how big it is when we clear the screen, since nobody seems to believe in actually sending SIGWINCH on VMS. (a0cfba5)
- work around a bug in iTerm.app Build 0.9.6.20090209 which caused it to report window title and icon name with the wrong escape sequences (c8ae8c1)
- fall back order: TIOCGWINSZ -> TIOCGSIZE -> LINES, COLS when USE_IOCTL is true (eb34fc5)
- of course, a successful cursor position report means we ignore the OS even on VMS (86b5692)
- in VMS, the OS always wins when it comes to terminal size. (7a65fa2)
- *** empty log message *** (5c1d273)
- iosbdef.h does not exist on VAX (6e72f7a)
- no color bold for decterm (1de0174)

- __BSD44_CURSES is treated just like _BSD44_CURSES (ff8252f)
- missed one! (1f4e4a7)
- slightly saner DANGEROUS_ATTRS handling; safer handling of MY_A_REVERSE too (c575187)
- refactored standout-avoidance code as DANGEROUS_ATTRS=1 and VMS/OpenVMS support; now works 100% with the OpenVMS BSD 4.4 curses; works except for blocking getch() with the classic VMS curses too; still appears to work with both ncurses and "real" BSD curses too (e2fb3a7)
- more flexible, defaults to VMS curses but also allows BSD 4.4 curses (723eb58)
- cbreak works now, at least (8b214db)
- support attributes in VMS curses (0d554e6)
- vms build script with corrected line endings (aa4f054)

- the ,sfgroup does not seem to actually work with FRS (3f988ae)
- revert accidentally-committed code-in-progress (18d0f7c)
- works with Mac OS X 10.1.5 SDK and Libcurses-24 from apple using --with-bsdcurses (you must statically link libcurses.a for this to work and produce an executable which will work on more recent Mac OS X releases, and you must set LIBTERMCAP= and make sure to have an appropriate termcap installed) (2283f9e)
- base A_STANDOUT on the BSD curses _STANDOUT (6e49026)
- now we use a simple -DOLDCURSES to enable all the workarounds for classic BSD curses (4f305d7)
- simulate attrset(A_STANDOUT) using standout()/standend() in a way compatible with old BSD curses, working around a BSD curses bug in the process (59389c7)

- allow number of ghosts to vary from level to level (04f6854)
- add champion boards (9e37ef4)
- preserve continuations (b2cb8cc)
- a few fixes for the "k3" variant (e3d07a4)
- added a variant based on IÃ±aki Ecenarro's K3 (aefd6db)
- permit whitespace in long and double lists, and allow them to be given as quoted words (4449273)
- allow continuations on the first line (03ce740)
- added 3b1 variant, and split variant and size lists across lines for cleaner future diffs (d92780f)
- allow libcaca myman to be compiled for win32 (117f0c5)
- fix intro color bug caused by relying on USE_COLOR preprocessor symbol in code moved to utils.c (53c020c)
- another typo (318011d)
- typo (0a4bd27)
- dump a list of available drivers when driver initialization fails (e400157)
- more support for Aztec C; we still run out of memory there, though (481488e)
- add Aztec C helper script and batch file (they don't actually work yet, though) (00da5f0)
- these hacks work a bit better now (ea85b5a)
- preliminary batch-file for Aztec C86 5.2a (843ecf9)
- it is just an AROS driver for now, after all; m68k-amigaos-gcc cannot compile it using libnix etc. (7aeaa5e)
- mention that rawcurses works on AROS (49740b5)
- add completely untested support for window bounds checking on future-AROS; hide the cursor on AROS; get RAWCURSES_RELCUP a bit closer to working on AROS (40ae4ad)
- auto-wrap supposedly works ona real Amiga (e28cc66)
- somewhat-working on AROS now; might also work on AmigaOS and/or MorphOS, but I do not have those so I cannot test them. (bc7af89)
- #define USE_SGTTY 1 and #define USE_TERMIOS 0 if you would like to use the old BSD-style tty interface rather than termios (c997210)

- oops! fix project id in sf logo url (53a5755)
- shell.sf.net is dead; cope (142dd0e)
- quote compiler command when echoing; add missing zero install website files to distribution (63cf5ab)
- added a zero install feed for x86 linux (c399479)
- use ncurses[w]5-config to detect ncurses[w] compilation and linking flags (b476be8)
- allow a few variables to be snarfed from the environment by "configure"; also document a few salient Makefile variables in configure -help (fdbf5c0)

- move stdlib.h before string.h (8a4ff69)
- allow building cvsdump, dist and bindist by archive name (eb735f9)
- switch to %{buildroot}; remove compressed manpages manually, since Makefile is ignorant of them (db1bd36)
- more workarounds for Linux command-line length limits (d692a21)
- mandb should be defanged, too (f74323f)
- closer to working (aa8825a)
- root is a better owner for this stuff (b372064)
- oops! forgot to prefix with RPM_BUILD_ROOT (ec971e2)
- add support for --target, although we ignore it (8f461df)
- closer to working (9b6928a)
- closer to working (a338b67)
- hopefully closer to correct (e79be2e)
- added release (df2a369)
- updated to reflect newer RPM spec file syntax (6799707)
- fix typo (3370fdb)
- initial RPM spec file (dad7613)
- do not install EXTRAPROGS when there are none; this avoids a shell syntax error (93f6a74)
- use more portable variable expansion syntax (b4d34f2)
- use a wrapper macro when calling gettimeofday(2) since some really broken systems (ahem... SVID3!) do not take a second parameter; also rename the "lines" and "columns" global variables by prefixing them with "myman_" to avoid conflicting with some internal TenDRA identifiers (35baa53)
- remove obsolete references to privatelibexecdir (b3383c9)
- add missing ${EXTRAPROGS} dependency for install-files (3f3d16e)
- allow (un)installing additional program files to ${bindir}, e.g. EXTRAPROGS=myman.bc for LLVM bytecode (the "myman" executable in that case is merely a shell script) (c18af14)
- changes to automatically use [HOST]LD when they are provided for linking; this allows us to use LLVM! sh configure --host=llvm HOSTCFLAGS=-emit-llvm OBJ_SUFFIX=.ll HOSTLD=llvm-ld (5f0105a)
- minor portability fixes, thanks to TenDRA (415c956)
- clean up compiler flag handling so we work inside modern dpkg-buildpackage (413672c)
- avoid overlong command line for "make dist" (workaround needed for bash on Linux) (ca5f4ef)
- more host detection moved to guess.h (8d39c8c)
- move lots of detection code to "guess.h" (27e79d6)
- better preprocessor symbols (cc388f8)
- hopefully fix encoding problems (c8f1e51)
- hopefully fix encoding problems (3c4bfd0)
- more removal of spurious GNU variable syntax in Makefile (507e426)
- feh... we need -o foo for gcc, but -ofoo for some others. anyhow, we will ship it gcc-style (0ca3bea)
- remove a GNUism (41007c9)
- remove one GNUism, but many others remain (00a2fd8)
- do not include utils.h if it has already been included (6de8e29)
- added missing simplej levels (07ddb06)
- oops! forgot to add p4c (d0e2f4b)
- first cut at Debian and Fink support; currently untested (5140547)
- support for building windows icons into the executable using quite a few different compilers and resource compilers (de06383)
- use correct extension (.res) for compiled Win32 resources; add support for Borland's brc32 resource compiler and resource linking quirks of Borland's bcc32 (use #pragma resource "..." in a C++ file) (cb1975a)
- better support for Borland C++ <conio.h>, and use a better check for Conio2 (6a4cdb2)
- now works with bcc32 (Borland C++ Compiler) for Win32 (f0b715a)
- use newer syntax when testing for WIN32 (49e136a)
- new compile() and hostcompile() shell functions for inserting extra definitions into the compiler command line at the correct point; now all compilation is echoed by these functions; also added preliminary support for Borland C++ Compiler 5.5 (bcc32) (66b68a2)
- use new creator code (b52e004)
- set our spiffy new Creator code 'MyMa' on non-"MPW Tool" builds (32cb7da)
- actually, allow gcc explicitly (more appropriate, sicne most people install it as gC, regardless of whether it's generating code for the PowerPC target or generating code for the 68k target.) (4570f7d)
- allow "C" for compiling with an older MPW. actually, though, my "C" is a copy of gcc Stan Shebs ported some time back, so I don't know whether our code compiles with the real "C" (which appears to no longer be available in any form.) (e92e132)
- don't forget to flush! (986f81f)
- clarified. added a note about Executor apparently wcorking. (f04b5e7)
- To run inside the Executor demo we have to pass through mouse-up events (4c366c4)
- updated comments (77fc6b7)
- ppc and 68k each get 700k (d54afb4)
- less memory for carbon too to account for the vm filemapping overhead added by OS9 (a16cdcd)
- workarounds for more missing toolbox routines (31907b5)
- smaller partition, since OS9 automagically adds to the displayed value to account for VM (and hence file-mapping) being off (7cfd391)
- added (disabled) partially-working off-screen drawing support; rolled our own "constrain window to screen" routine which seems to mostly work (6750edd)
- ! shows some basic info for the "About" menu item; the menu actually works in non-Carbon builds too, now; disabled the optimizer for now in MPW builds, it seemed like it might be causing problems; we now support the U+F8FF menu and the Font too in non-carbon builds (3d056c6)
- MyMan will now compile for 68k using Universal Interfaces 2.1.5 (and there is a new -sdkroot-68k option to specify this); you can also specify the regular SDK root using -sdkroot; do not build debugging info by default, and optimize for space instead (dd3ca7a)
- remove tray comment (d45bb3e)
- carbon builds now are "fat" 68k+carbon builds by default; explicitly build "carbon-ppc" for the old behavior (bb04189)
- color QuickDraw is no longer required. System 7+ still seems to be, though. (c8c88b2)
- only bother with slow escaping operations in build mode (720240d)
- we should explicitly set the type code after all (d075312)
- much more robust quoting for srcdir and for string literals passed to the C preprocessor; also factored out common parts of the various host createmake permutations (751adb1)
- fixed very buggy HFS workarounds to be less buggy. they still only really work for plain-ASCII filenames, but that is far better than not working at all. perhaps someday the poorly-documented ConvertUnixPathToHFSPath from CarbonStdCLib will be used for PowerPC hosts instead of this gruesome hack (6973251)
- remove debugging printout (953c095)
- fixed posix path generation (8ef67bb)
- typo! (it broke subdirectory builds) (1777804)
- moved macbuild.txt to the utl subdirectory (f49e1cb)
- classic mac build actually generates a mostly-working executable; CFM-68K is still completely broken; MPW carbon build is currently b0rked under OS X, but that is fixable; MPW build script is a lot smarter (dc13b67)
- silly code to stifle warnings (601ba11)
- hopefully the classic mac os workarounds in fopen_datafile suck less now (52cfe34)
- PowerPC toolbox finally seems to work correctly (3bbb57c)
- built u2m as a fat tool (0162a16)
- typo: .NJ  cruft was left behind (7ee5f18)
- noted that the MPW Carbon application requires CarbonLib 1.6 to run; overhauled macbuild.txt so that sizes, hosts, and/or host-size combinations can be specified on the command-line, and explicitly specified or non-default hosts have their identifiers prefixed to built executable names; generated files other than the final executable are now removed by the build script (d779cb8)
